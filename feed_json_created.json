Each solution would be designed using numerous technology partners, each with their own range of compute, storage, networking and backup technologies.</p>\n<p>My methods to create as-built documentation was arduous, time consuming and error prone. It often involved extracting information using a combination of vendor supplied tools and community developed scripts, and manually transposing information from the vCenter console into a Word document. It was tedious and often resulted in a poorly constructed and formatted document.</p>\n<p>It was also around this time that I realised I had a strong desire to learn PowerShell after seeing many of my co-workers starting to write scripts to automate simple, repeatable tasks. Until this moment, I had never taken the time to completely understand the fundamentals of PowerShell, nor had I worked to develop and expand my knowledge in any form of scripting or automation.</p>\n<p>As a result, I saw this as an opportunity to learn and employ PowerShell automation to ease my pain and frustrations with producing as-built documentation. And so began my mission to create AsBuiltReport!</p>", "image": "https://www.asbuiltreport.com/assets/images/social/blog\\posts\\The-history-of-As-Built-Report.png", "date_published": "2023-08-25T09:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Tim Carman"}], "tags": ["General"]}]}
