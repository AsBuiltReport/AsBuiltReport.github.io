### Description

New-AsBuiltConfig starts a menu-driven procedure in the PowerShell console asking the user a series of questions to create a JSON configuration file. The JSON configuration file may be saved and referenced by the ‘AsBuiltConfigPath’ parameter in New-AsBuiltReport.

New-AsBuiltConfig is automatically called by New-AsBuiltReport if the ‘AsBuiltConfigPath’ parameter is not specified. If a user wishes to generate a new As Built Report configuration without generating a new report, this command can be called as a standalone cmdlet.

### Parameters

There are no additional parameters for this command.
