Each solution would be designed using numerous technology partners, each with their own range of compute, storage, networking and backup technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My methods to create as-built documentation was arduous, time consuming and error prone. It often involved extracting information using a combination of vendor supplied tools and community developed scripts, and manually transposing information from the vCenter console into a Word document. It was tedious and often resulted in a poorly constructed and formatted document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also around this time that I realised I had a strong desire to learn PowerShell after seeing many of my co-workers starting to write scripts to automate simple, repeatable tasks. Until this moment, I had never taken the time to completely understand the fundamentals of PowerShell, nor had I worked to develop and expand my knowledge in any form of scripting or automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, I saw this as an opportunity to learn and employ PowerShell automation to ease my pain and frustrations with producing as-built documentation. And so began my mission to create As Built Report!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.asbuiltreport.com/blog/2023/08/25/the-history-of-asbuiltreport/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:04:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.asbuiltreport.com/feed_rss_updated.xml">AsBuiltReport</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.asbuiltreport.com/blog/2023/08/25/the-history-of-asbuiltreport/</guid> <enclosure url="https://www.asbuiltreport.com/assets/images/social/blog\2023\08\25\the-history-of-asbuiltreport.png" type="image/png" length="51176" /> </item> <item> <title>The future of As Built Report</title> <author>Tim Carman</author> <category>General</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;The future of As Built Report&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;../posts/The-history-of-As-Built-Report.md&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I shared how I came to start As Built Report and my reasons for doing so. It&#39;s been a few years since its inception and some of you may be asking what does the future hold for the project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I delve into what may lie ahead, let me take a moment to reflect on the project&#39;s progression so far, by extending a sincere thank you to all the &lt;a href=&#34;../../about/contributors.md&#34;&gt;contributors&lt;/a&gt; who have given their time and effort to this project. Whether you have contributed code, reported bugs, provided feedback, written a blog post, or simply participated in discussions, your efforts have not gone unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.asbuiltreport.com/blog/2023/12/05/The-future-of-As-Built-Report/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:04:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.asbuiltreport.com/feed_rss_updated.xml">AsBuiltReport</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.asbuiltreport.com/blog/2023/12/05/The-future-of-As-Built-Report/</guid> <enclosure url="https://www.asbuiltreport.com/assets/images/social/blog\2023\12\05\The-future-of-As-Built-Report.png" type="image/png" length="49865" /> </item> </channel></rss>
