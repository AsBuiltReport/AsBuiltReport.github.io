As I sit here in isolation, suffering from the effects for COVID, it's clear that this project is no longer high on my priority list. After experiencing two years of the world's most severe lockdowns here in Melbourne, I realised that spending long periods of time in front of a computer screen, constantly thinking about work, was negatively impacting my mental health. I had no discipline in switching off from any of this. I became exhausted and burnt out!</p> <p>Since the end of lockdown, most of us have changed our working habits and work-life balance in some way, whether it's working from home, limiting our screen time, or getting out and about more frequently. I continue to work on incorporating all of these into my daily routine, but the one I'm most strict about is spending less time in front of my computer. While I have always put my family first, I cannot say the same for my health. Changes need to be made.</p> <p>When I first started AsBuiltReport, I was working with a wide range of IT infrastructure on a daily basis and would often have the time and access to develop many of the reports you use today. However this is no longer the case, as I have taken on a new job role earlier this year and am now solely focused on Azure-related projects. As a result, I no longer have the time or access to this infrastructure to keep many of these reports up to date.</p> <p>So herein lies the challenge! Without access to the IT infrastructure and with less time in my daily schedule, I can no longer maintain this project and will need more help from you, the users, to keep this project alive and relevant!</p> <p>I created and shared this project in response to the overwhelming positive feedback I received following my VMworld presentation in 2018. Following my presentation, many people apporached me and asked how they could get involved. I didn't have any set expectations at the time, and I've always wanted this tool to be freely available for everyone to use, but in the past few years, I've noticed that most users expect myself or Jonathan to develop or fix reports, rather than exploring ways to develop or fix a report themselves. While I am grateful for those who have contributed thus far, I continue to believe that there is still a large amount of untapped potential within our user base that could elevate the project further.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/12/05/The-future-of-As-Built-Report/#but-what-does-this-all-mean","title":"But... what does this all mean?","text":"<p>To be clear, I have no plans to abandon this project, but I would like to take a step back.

Each solution would be designed using numerous technology partners, each with their own range of compute, storage, networking and backup technologies.</p> <p>My methods to create as-built documentation was arduous, time consuming and error prone. It often involved extracting information using a combination of vendor supplied tools and community developed scripts, and manually transposing information from the vCenter console into a Word document. It was tedious and often resulted in a poorly constructed and formatted document.</p> <p>It was also around this time that I realised I had a strong desire to learn PowerShell after seeing many of my co-workers starting to write scripts to automate simple, repeatable tasks. Until this moment, I had never taken the time to completely understand the fundamentals of PowerShell, nor had I worked to develop and expand my knowledge in any form of scripting or automation.</p> <p>As a result, I saw this as an opportunity to learn and employ PowerShell automation to ease my pain and frustrations with producing as-built documentation. And so began my mission to create AsBuiltReport!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/08/25/the-history-of-asbuiltreport/#asbuiltreport-was-born","title":"AsBuiltReport was born!","text":"<p>AsBuiltReport began as a single PowerShell script to capture information from VMware vSphere environments, however I quickly realised that my need to produce as-built documentation needed to extend beyond just VMware, and required the ability to capture information from a wide range of vendors and technologies.</p> <p>After developing the basic concepts of gathering information from VMware vSphere using PowerCLI, I was left without a mechanism to present and output the information in an acceptable document format. Had it not been for a colleague telling me about PScribo, I doubt AsBuiltReport would have ever seen the light of day.</p> <p>PScribo was the solution I had long been searching for. Not only did it provide the capabilities to export information into Word, HTML and Text formats, it was also extremely simple to grasp and implement. I now had all the pieces to the puzzle!</p> <p>In March 2018, I delivered my first ever presentation at the Melbourne VMUG User Conference, to showcase my initial work on the VMware vSphere as-built script. My presentation, despite its terrible delivery, was warmly welcomed by the local audience, giving me the confidence and motivation I needed to keep working on the script.</p> <p>AsBuiltReport had taken months of my personal effort to produce by this point. I understood then, as I had known from the start, that it would be impossible for me to continue developing the project on my own. Having benefited so much from VMware's community contributions, I saw this as my opportunity to give back to the vCommunity by sharing what I had created, and allowing others to develop their own reports.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/08/25/the-history-of-asbuiltreport/#vmworld-us-2018","title":"VMworld US 2018","text":"<p>In August 2018, Matt Allford and I presented 'Documenting Your Virtual Infrastructure with PowerShell and PowerCLI' to a worldwide audience of 500+ people at VMworld in Las Vegas.

If the changes are related to an existing GitHub issue, please reference the issue in the PR description (e.g. Fix #11)</li> <li>It's recommended to avoid a PR with too many changes.

For large features, try to approach it in an incremental way, so that each PR won't be too big.</li> <li> <p>Add a meaningful title of the PR describing what change you want to check in. Don't simply put: \"Fix issue #5\". Also don't directly use the issue title as the PR title.
